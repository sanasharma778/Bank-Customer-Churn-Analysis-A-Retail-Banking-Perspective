# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis-A-Retail-Banking-Perspective
A data analysis project on customer churn for a retail bank. This repository showcases my skills in Python, SQL, and machine learning to predict customer churn, identify key factors, and provide data-driven business recommendations and insights to improve customer retention. 

The dataset, sourced from the Maven Data Repository, was used to perform a comprehensive analysis.

-> Key Objectives- 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To understand key factors influencing customer churn.

Predictive Modeling: To build a machine learning model that predicts which customers are most likely to churn.

Actionable Insights: To provide targeted strategies for the bank to retain high-value customers.

-> Project Highlights & Key Takeaways- 
Identified customer segments at high risk of churn.

Developed a predictive model (e.g., using XGBoost) to proactively flag potential churners.

Provided specific recommendations, such as personalized re-engagement campaigns for inactive members, cross-selling for single-product customers, and loyalty programs for at-risk, long-tenure customers.
